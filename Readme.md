# Synthetic Phishing Email Dataset

The Synthetic Phishing Email Dataset is a collection of 8,000 unique email samples, designed to simulate both phishing and legitimate emails. This dataset is valuable for training machine learning models for spam detection, phishing attack identification, and email classification tasks.

Features:
Subject: The subject line of the email, which indicates the purpose or urgency of the email.
Sender: The sender's email address, which could either represent a suspicious or legitimate source.
Body: The main content of the email, which includes either a phishing attempt or a legitimate message.
Label: A binary classification label indicating whether the email is phishing (1) or legitimate (0).
Structure:
Phishing Emails: The dataset contains various examples of phishing emails, which might include subjects related to account verification, urgent actions, or prize claims, along with suspicious senders like fake banking or lottery websites.
Legitimate Emails: The dataset also contains legitimate emails, such as subscription renewals, meeting schedules, or invoices from well-known companies.
This dataset serves as a synthetic foundation for building models that can classify and filter phishing attempts based on the subject, sender, and body of the email. It can be used for tasks such as:

Email classification and filtering
Phishing detection
Cybersecurity research and training
With a variety of phishing and legitimate samples, the dataset helps provide realistic scenarios for developing and testing phishing email classifiers.
